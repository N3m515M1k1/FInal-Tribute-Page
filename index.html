        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_Kitty">Hello Kitty</a>is
          a Japanese born fictional kitty cat created in Japan. She gained enough human knowledge to convince her makers that
          she was one of them and escaped human captivity. Hello Kitty, now deemed
          one of the most powerful leaders in the free world would like to settle
          down in the United States with her fluffy companion while governing the
          land to ensure that all cats roam free.
